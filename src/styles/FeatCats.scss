/* *** Lyrics to our impromptu song recording ***
 * Swerving in the civic lane to lane we be switchin
 * * Don't you miss it, blink twice and we'll hit it
 * Be the gas, hit it fast, never last 
 * * Be the tree, we stop fast, through the windsheild and the glass
 * Doesn't matter, we roll fatter, everynight getting louder
 * * hitting harder homers than the dedicated batter
 * Then we stop any home, pick a basement pick a phone,
 * * Hit up any girl near the neighborhood zone 
 * Sit a little while, spit a freestyle, cook up a beat,
 * * Sit on it awhile, get a little higher
 * And here we sit, bored as shit, mind feeling on the fritz
 * * And what to do? Never knew, the question only ever grew.
